NTD-302 — Nutube Overdrive / Distortion

Overview

NTD-302 is a high-voltage analog overdrive/distortion pedal featuring the Nutube 6P1, a revolutionary vacuum fluorescent display (VFD)–based triode device that reproduces true vacuum-tube behavior in an ultra-compact, low-power format.

This project is both a tribute and an exploration — a modern reinterpretation of tube saturation, created entirely in discrete analog circuitry.

Acknowledgement

This technology would not exist without the pioneering work of Fumio Saegusa (KORG) and Noritake Itron Corporation, who jointly developed the Nutube device.
As of 2026, Nutube celebrates its 10th anniversary (released September 23, 2016) and remarkably continues to be sold in Japan for the same price — ¥5,500 JPY (tax-included) — unchanged since launch, despite severe global inflation.

Interestingly, although Nutube was originally expected to replace traditional vacuum tubes after the Ukraine-related supply crisis, most audio communities concluded that Nutube was not a simple drop-in replacement.
Why?

Because Nutube introduces fundamentally different electrical requirements:

• Filament voltage must be tightly controlled (damage occurs above 0.7 V)
• Grid bias must be driven by positive voltage
• Anode voltage requires ≥12 V for proper performance (30 V is ideal)
• Requires three separate regulated rails (30 V / 9 V / 5 V)
• Demands strict grounding topology and noise isolation

These factors made Nutube development knowledge-heavy, power-sensitive, and electrically unforgiving — leading many designers to abandon the device prematurely.

NTD-302 exists to prove that Nutube can be the star — not a gimmick.

Circuit Concept

NTD-302 uses both triode sections of a single Nutube 6P1, connected in true serial amplification and driven by a regulated 30 V anode supply.

Signal flow:
JFET buffer → Nutube stage 1 → Nutube stage 2 → transistor buffer → frequency-dependent gain network → output volume

Unlike conventional distortion circuits, gain is not primarily voltage-based — it is frequency-selective.
A unique RC low-pass network performs tone-dependent amplification: reducing treble simultaneously increases perceived drive and thickness, producing a naturally compressed and creamy distortion character.

The final emitter stage introduces frequency shaping that allows:

• Sparkling Strat-style bite
• Thick humbucker-like low-end punch
• Wide dynamic response
• Extremely low noise floor

This pedal offers a fully analog, high-voltage Nutube distortion voice with fast attack, warm compression, and rich even-order harmonics.

Electrical Requirements
Rail	Requirement
30 V Anode	Inductor must meet saturation current spec
Rsc	0.22 Ω / 2 W (mandatory)
5 V Rail	≥ 1.5 A current capability (500 mA is insufficient)
Grounding	Star-ground topology by functional island is mandatory
Without strict star grounding and power isolation, the circuit will not function correctly.

Component Tolerance

Reference	Nominal	Acceptable
R4	2.9 kΩ	2.7 kΩ – 3 kΩ
R30	1.9 kΩ	1.5 kΩ – 2.2 kΩ
All other component values should be kept as specified.

Safety & Liability

This design is published as-is.
GolemMilk assumes no responsibility for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from construction or usage.
Builders must independently verify all electrical behavior before operation.

Case / Enclosure

For the enclosure, the circuit is designed to fit the following Takachi Electric Industrial aluminum cases:

Standard height version
Takachi Electric Industrial SPCP131808T
Marutsu Code: M0002-3623

This enclosure provides sufficient internal height to ensure safe mechanical clearance for the Nutube module, high-voltage power circuitry, and thermal stability while maintaining a compact footprint suitable for pedalboard use.

Low-profile version
For a thinner and lower-profile build, the following enclosure is also compatible:

Takachi Electric Industrial SPCP131806G
Marutsu Code: M0006-3822

Please use aitendo's "nutube10S" as the Nutube conversion board.
aitendo Code: P-NUTUBE10S

This version allows a slimmer pedal format while preserving the full electrical and sonic performance of the circuit.
Final Words

NTD-302 is released as a free, open hardware reference design —
built with love, respect, and deep admiration for guitar culture, analog electronics, and the art of distortion.

May this project serve as a foundation for the next generation of Nutube knowledge.

Rock on. 🎸
