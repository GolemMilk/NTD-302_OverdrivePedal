# NTD-302

**NTD-302** is a high-voltage Nutube preamp module designed for guitar and bass applications.  
It features an onboard boost converter generating 30V for the Nutube plate supply and a dedicated 5V regulated heater supply.

The circuit is optimized for low-noise operation using star-ground topology and separated power domains.

## Features

- KORG Nutube 6P1 based preamp
- Onboard 30V boost converter (NJM2360)
- Onboard 5V heater regulator
- Star-ground architecture for ultra-low noise
- Compact stompbox-oriented PCB layout
- Designed for true bypass 3PDT switching

## Power

- Input: 9V DC (Center Negative)
- Internal rails:
  - 30V (plate)
  - 5V (heater)
